# How to build a single page site with Flask

This repo contains some code and commentary for building a single page site with Flask. I've made the choice to go with Twitter Bootstrap as the sole provider of JavaScript.

Each example adds a feature to the site.

* Basic - Hello world example
* Templating - how to render a page in html
* Useful-templating = how to pass variable values to a template
* Styling - How to add CSS
* Javascript - How to add JavaScript
* Forms - Add a safe form using WTForms
